## XCode (BETA)

Rainglow is a collection of color themes for a number of different editors and platforms. This repository consists of **180+ syntax and UI themes** for [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

To show support for the project, you can do any (or many!) of the following:

- [Star the repository.](https://github.com/rainglow/xcode/stargazers)
- [Follow me on twitter, and say hi!](https://twitter.com/daylerees)
- [Share on refind.](https://refind.com/daylerees?invite=9125a6f6a7)
- [Share on product hunt.](https://www.producthunt.com/)
- [Buy my books!](https://daylerees.com/books/)
- [Donate via PayPal.](https://paypal.me/daylerees)

### IMPORTANT

This is in BETA stage because I'm not an Apple dev. I can only test it with basic knowledge. Be sure to report anything that looks odd!

### Manual Installation

Clone the repository and copy the contents of the themes directory into `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes`.

Restart XCode, and you'll find the new themes in the settings dialog.

### Useful Information

This project is an evolution of my colour schemes project found at [https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes](https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes). Peacock was the first ever theme. I created it to try and find something to use other than Monokai. It's now a favourite for many users!

If you'd like to report a bug with one of the color schemes, please raise an issue on the repository rather than submitting a pull request. This is because the themes run through a generation process, and editing the themes directly is not advised!

Have a wonderful day!
